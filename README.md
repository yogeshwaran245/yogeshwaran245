## 🚀 About Me

I'm Yogeshwaran, a passionate AI/ML engineer with a focus on deep learning, computer vision, and real-world impact. I enjoy building intelligent systems that solve everyday problems — from automation to agriculture. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in AIML, I’ve gained practical experience through internships and hands-on projects that merge innovation with usability. Always learning, always building.
My core mission is to build scalable, intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I love blending **model performance** with **deployment readiness**.
